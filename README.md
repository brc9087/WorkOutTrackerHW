# WorkOutTrackerHW
Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat. Whenever a user submits a burger's name, your app will display the burger on the top of the page under ready to eat area -- waiting to be devoured. Each burger in the ready to eat area also has a Devour button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the bottom of the page under devoured burgers. Each burger on the will have a Delete Button. When the user clicks delete, it will be removed from the db and the page.
